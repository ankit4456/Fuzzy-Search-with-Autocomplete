Fuzzy Search with Autocomplete - MERN Stack Application

I have successfully implemented a full-stack MERN application with intelligent fuzzy search and real-time autocomplete functionality.

KEY FEATURES:
✅ React search bar with real-time autocomplete suggestions (300ms debounce)
✅ Fuzzy search using Fuse.js library handling typos and partial words
✅ MongoDB text indexes on name, description, category, and tags
✅ Express.js REST API endpoint returning top 10 relevant suggestions
✅ Smart relevance sorting prioritizing exact matches
✅ Interactive dropdown with keyboard navigation
✅ Item detail pages with navigation
✅ Responsive design for all devices

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
- Database: MongoDB Atlas with text indexes
- Search: Fuse.js fuzzy matching (threshold: 0.4, field weights optimized)
- Deployment: Both frontend and backend hosted on Render (Web Service)

SEARCH ALGORITHM:
- Fuse.js with Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- Field weights: Name (70%), Description (20%), Category (5%), Tags (5%)
- Custom relevance scoring for exact/prefix matches
- Returns top 10 results sorted by relevance

DATASET:
- 88 indexed items across 8 categories (Electronics, Appliances, Footwear, Accessories, Furniture, Fitness, Stationery, Home & Garden)

DEPLOYMENT:
- Frontend: Live on Render (Web Service)
- Backend: Live on Render (Web Service)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
- All services production-ready and fully functional

TESTING:
- Verified with typos ("laptp" → "Laptop Computer")
- Partial words ("keyb" → "Mechanical Keyboard")
- Wrong spelling ("headfones" → "Headphones")
- All features tested and working in production

The application is fully deployed, tested, and ready for evaluation.
